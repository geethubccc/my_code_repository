You are going to read a serial of none-negative integers, which ends with a negative number that does not count as one of the data. Your program calculates the average of all 
the none-negative integers, and prints the average which rounds to two decimal places.
When there's no valid data at all, your program prints out:
None

输入格式：
A serial of none-negative integers, ending with a negative number, which is not one of the valide data.
输出格式：
A number rounds to two decimal places, which is the average of the serial.
The printf for this case is:
printf("%.2f\n", (double)sum/count);

输入例子
1 2 3 4 5 6 -1
输出例子
3.50

Code(gcc):
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int sum,i,k;
    double avr;
    sum=0;
    k=0;
    while(1)
    {
        scanf("%d",&i);
        if(i>0)
        {
            sum+=i;
            k++;
        }
        else if(i<0)
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    avr=1.0*sum/k;
    if(k>0)
    {
        printf("%.2f",avr);
    }
    else if(k==0)
    {
        printf("None");
    }
    return 0;
}
